[description]
en = """The Krishna-paksha Ekadashi of `kArttika` month is known as `utpannA-EkAdazI`.

Yudhiṣṭhira inquires about the origin of the auspicious Ekādaśī day and its importance in the universe, especially for the deities. In response, Bhagavan Viṣṇu narrates a story from the Kṛta yuga about a fierce demon named Mura, who terrorized the Devas, even defeating Indra and forcing them to flee from Svarga. Seeking help, Indra and the Devas approached Bhagavan Śiva, who directed them to Bhagavan Viṣṇu, the protector.

The Devas, led by Indra, found Bhagavan Viṣṇu asleep in the water and pleaded for his help. Bhagavan Viṣṇu inquired about the demon, and Indra explained Mura's origins, his strength, and how he had created an alternate realm of Devas and occupied Svarga. Enraged, Bhagavan Viṣṇu vowed to defeat Mura and attacked his forces. Though many demons were killed, Mura proved to be a formidable opponent, leading to a protracted battle with Bhagavan Viṣṇu that lasted a thousand divine years.

Eventually, exhausted, Bhagavan Viṣṇu retreated to the cave of Siṃhavatī in Badarikāśrama to rest. Mura pursued him, believing he had won. As Bhagavan Viṣṇu slept, Mura prepared to kill him. At that moment, a divine maiden, born from Bhagavan Viṣṇu's radiance, appeared and challenged Mura. In a fierce battle, the maiden, using her divine powers, defeated Mura and reduced him to ash with a single powerful sound.

When Bhagavan Viṣṇu awoke, he was astonished to find Mura defeated and asked the maiden how she had accomplished this feat. She explained that she killed Mura to protect the world while Bhagavan Viṣṇu slept. Bhagavan Viṣṇu, impressed, offered her a boon. The maiden, who identified herself as Ekādaśī, requested to be the most auspicious of days, granting all those who fast in her honor health, wealth, righteousness, and ultimately, salvation. Bhagavan Viṣṇu granted her wish, decreeing that Ekādaśī would become the holiest day, capable of destroying all sins and conferring (even) salvation to those who observe it. Thus came about the birth of Ekādaśī and the Ekādaśī vrata itself---thus, this day in Kartika

The fruits of fasting on Ekādaśī are greatly extolled in the Padma Purana—
A person who bathes at Śaṃkhoddhāra and beholds the image of Viṣṇu does not acquire even a sixteenth of the merit earned by fasting on Ekādaśī. O noble king, even if one gives four lakhs of coins on the days of the Sun's transition between Zodiac signs, it does not equal even a sixteenth of the merit from an Ekādaśī fast! Indeed, fasting on Ekādaśī grants the same religious merit as bathing at Prabhāsa during a lunar or solar eclipse. One who drinks the sacred water at Kedāra is freed from rebirth, and likewise, fasting on Ekādaśī removes the cycle of rebirth. 
The merit from an Ekādaśī fast is a hundred times greater than the reward of performing an Ashvamedha sacrifice on earth. Fasting on Ekādaśī yields a hundredfold more merit than gifting a thousand cows to a learned brāhmaṇa. Those who fast on Ekādaśī are considered equal to those whose bodies are inhabited by Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva. The merit from observing the Ekādaśī vow is immeasurable, and difficult to obtain even by the Devas. There is no other vow like that of the Ekādaśī, that destroys sins."""
