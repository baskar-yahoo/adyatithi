Renovating the huge dilapidated maṭha, He remained happily in Kāñci itself by devoting himself every day in the worship of Goddess Kāmākṣī. He, the benevolent great preceptor Saccidānandaghana having travelled upto Himalayas attained liberation on the eighth day of bright fortnight of the month Bhādrapada in the year Khara. He was also known as Bhāṣaparameṣṭi and his preceptorship was for twenty years."
