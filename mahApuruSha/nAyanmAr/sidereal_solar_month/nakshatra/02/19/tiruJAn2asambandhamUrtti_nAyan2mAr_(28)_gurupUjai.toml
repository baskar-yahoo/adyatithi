Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavachakar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`ta:nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 28th of the Nayanmars, Thirugnana Sambandar, born to a devout Brahmana couple in 7th-century Sirkazhi, was an answer to his father's prayers for a son who would revive the glory of Shaivism. At the age of three, during a visit to the Sattainathar Shiva Temple, Sambandar was left by his parents near a pond. While alone, he began to cry and was comforted and fed by Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva, appearing as Thoniappar. His parents found milk on his lips and upon questioning, Sambandar pointed skyward and spontaneously composed his first hymn, “Thodudaiya Seviyan,” symbolizing his reception of divine wisdom or Shivajnanam. This event marked him as Thirugnana Sambandar, the saint of divine knowledge, and Aludaiya Pillayar, the Lord’s child.

Celebrated as Tala Vendan, the unrivaled master of rhythm in the Periyapuranam, Sambandar demonstrated prodigious talents from a young age. By the time he was seven, he began singing about the Vedas and authored a significant collection of hymns, forming volumes 1-3 of the Thirumurai. His life was notable for successfully debating with Jain monks and converting the hunchbacked king Koon Pandyan back to Shaivism.

As his wedding approached at age 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During this time, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the “Panchakshara Padigam,” everyone present achieved union with Lord Shiva, symbolizing the ultimate union of the soul with the Divine.
