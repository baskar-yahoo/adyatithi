Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`ta:nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

In the fertile region of Kancharur within the Chola kingdom, a devout follower of Lord Shiva named Manakancharanar, the 12th Nayanmar, lived. Belonging to a Vellala family and respected as a hereditary Senathipathi, he was known for his ability to intuitively serve Shiva Bhaktas without them having to ask. After a long period without children, his devout prayers were answered with the birth of a daughter, whose arrival he celebrated with extensive charity.

As the daughter grew and reached marriageable age, she was betrothed to Eyarkon Kalikamar, another sincere devotee of Lord Shiva. The wedding was planned, but before it could take place, Lord Shiva decided to bestow a special blessing upon Manakancharanar. Assuming the guise of a Maha-Vrathiar, a holy man with distinctive ash markings and a garland of bones, Lord Shiva appeared before Manakancharanar. Inquiring about the festive preparations, the ascetic learned of the impending wedding and expressed a desire for the bride's hair to make a Panchavati, a sacred thread.

Without hesitation and disregarding the potential consequences, including the possibility of the groom rejecting his disfigured daughter, Manakancharanar cut off his daughter's hair and offered it to the ascetic. Immediately after, Lord Shiva revealed his true form to Manakancharanar and his family, blessing them.

When Eyarkon Kalikamar and his party arrived and learned of the incident, they were initially dismayed, but Lord Shiva, understanding the situation, miraculously restored the daughter's hair. Relieved and overjoyed, Manakancharanar and his family proceeded with the wedding, celebrating the divine intervention and the deep devotion that led to it.
