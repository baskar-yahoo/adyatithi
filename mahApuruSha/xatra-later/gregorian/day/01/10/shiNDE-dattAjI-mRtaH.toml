10 Jan 1760 will be remembered for the defence of Delhi by an outnumbered Maratha army from the Afghan armies of  Ahmed Shah Abdali & Najib Khan Rohilla. Dattaji Scindia laid down his life at Burari ghat Delhi. (Earlier, Ahmad Shah Durrani on his fifth invasion was defeated by the Marathas in the Battle of Lahore (1759).)

The tale of how Dattaji, Jayaji Scindia, Malharrao Holkar came close to renovating Kashi temple but then failed is interesting. The trio sent a msg to Kashi Pandits in 1750 that they were coming to renovate the temple. However, the Pandits refused due to Muslim fear
