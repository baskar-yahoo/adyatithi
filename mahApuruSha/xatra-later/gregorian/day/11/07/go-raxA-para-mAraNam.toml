On this day, thousands of sAdhu-s protesting against cow slaughtered were fired upon by police under Indira G. 

## Events
On the morning of 7 November, a few hundred thousand people, predominantly from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha, and Arya Samaj, had assembled from far-off places at an open space near the Parliamentary Complex. A vast majority of them were Sadhus. Swami Rameshwaranand, a Jan Sangh legislator who'd been expelled for 10 days rose to the podium and urged the protestors to  "to teach a lesson" by forcing the Parliament to close down. The mob broke barricades, police responded with tear gas and cane clubs. Then at around 1:30 pm, the police engaged in rifle fire and mounted a charge with lead-tipped clubs. The mob dispersed to other parts of delhi and vandalized property belonging to the ruling party and the government.

## Aftermath
The riot ended at around 4:30 pm with a death toll of eight and hundreds injured. A curfew was imposed; army deployed, unlawful assembly banned. About 1,500 demonstrators, including over 500 ascetics and prominent leaders of Hindu Nationalist parties and SGMS, were arrested. Beginning on 17 November, Sadhus started courting arrest, as planned. On the 20th, Prabhudutt Brahmachari and the Shankaracharya of Puri began hunger strikes; others soon followed.

Gandhi used this time to set up a joint parliamentary committee (deliberately filled with trusted secularists, federalists and people with an economic interest in the beef trade) - their agenda was to examine the 'feasibility' of a 'total ban on the slaughter of the cow and its progeny' and deliver a recommendation within a time frame of six months. In the meantime, Gandhi once again recommended on 5 January 1967 that states enact their own bans on cow slaughter. Shankaracharya broke his fast; it had lasted 73 days.

Overall, the agitation propelled the Hindu Right into the foreground of national politics for the first time. The episode also played a significant role in Gandhi's choosing to shift away from the staunch secular ideals displayed by her father, embracing the Hindu way of life.
