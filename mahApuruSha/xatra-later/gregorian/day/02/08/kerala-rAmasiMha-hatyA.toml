Ramasimhan, his brother Dayasimhan, Dayasimhan’s wife Kamala, their cook Raju Iyer and other members of the family were butchered by Islamist Jihadists in Malaparamba, Malappuram district on this day for converting to Hinduism from Islam in 1947, just two weeks before the independence. The jihadis completely demolished the Narasimha Temple too.

The young children Fateh Singh and Swaravar Singh escaped death as they were studying in Birla School, Delhi. The massacre of Ramasimham’s family was said to be sponsored by his Muslim father-in-law who couldn’t bear their conversion to Hinduism.

## Background
Ramasimhan’s father Moidu Saheb, was trained in rubber cultivation. Moidu Saheb occupied 600 acres of Narasimha Moorti Temple land in Malaparamba, Malappuram. He started cultivating rubber in the Temple land, managed to get the land on lease and even constructed a bungalow in front of the Temple. Moidu and his sons Unnyen and Alippu, took out granite slabs and other beautiful ornate structures from the Temple and used them for his bungalow. The local Hindus, though horrified at the loot of the Temple could not muster any protest as they had suffered more than 10,000 deaths, thousands of rapes and plunder at the hands of the Moplahs in the anti-Hindu riots under the garb of Khilafat Movement.

Unnyen soon fell very sick and all medical treatment proved very futile. The astrologer asked him to rebuild the Narasimha Moorti Temple, which was in ruins and desecrated by his own father. Unnyen rebuilt the Temple and started worshipping Narasimha Bhagwan. He miraculously recovered from his illness. Unnyen, his brother Alippu and the whole family became Bhaktas of Mahavishnu. The whole family, Unnyen, his brother Alippu, Alippu’s wife and Unnyen’s sons Moidu and Moidootty underwent a Gharwapasi ceremony conducted by the Arya Samaj and embraced Hinduism. They also renamed themselves as Ramasimhan, Dayasimhan, Kamala, Fateh Singh and Swaravar Singh respectively. They also became strict vegetarians, led a very pious religious life as Hindus.

## Aftermath
Their dismembered bodies remained untouched for two days till the Police came. The local Hindus did not dare to claim the bodies to cremate them according to Hindu rituals. They were buried in some corner near old Travellers Bungalow in Malaparamba. 

The demolished Narasimhan Temple was re-built in late 1990s due to valiant efforts by late RSS Pracharaks CP Janardhanan and late RSS Pracharak and former BMS President, R Venugopalan.

In 2021, film director Ali Akbar drew inspiration (and name) from rAmasiMhan when he renounced Islam in protest to Islamist celebrations on social media following the news of the death of General Bipin Rawat.
