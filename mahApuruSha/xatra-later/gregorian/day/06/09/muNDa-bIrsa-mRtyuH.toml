On this day Birsa Munda died in jail, a few days after his capture. In a short life of about 25 years, he had developed into an anti-British and anti-Missionary muNDa leader. Early in life he threw off a 3 year old Christian conversion (with the name "Birsa David") required for German Mission school admission; studied rAmAyaNa and gItA influenced by a vaiShNava weaver, then wearing a tilaka and a yajjnopavIta. 3 more years later, he began to lead his own hindu-tribal amalgam "Birsait" cult as "Dharti Aba".
