On this anniversary  (as per Gregorian calendar) of the battle of Haldighati, in the very same udayapura of mahrANa pratApasiMha, at about 2:45PM, two young jihAdis - Mohammed Riyaz Akhtar and Mohammed Ghous - posing as customers suddenly attacked and beheaded a tailor kanhaiya lAl when he was taking measurements. They had circulated videos threatening to carry out the attack (and instigating correligionist mobsters to do the same); also a video of the attack, and further a post-attack video boasting of the attack with display of bloody butcher knifes, with threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

## Motive
Nupur Sharma, BJP spokesperson, in a heated TV debate in the background of the discovery of a shiva-linga being used to wash feet in jNAnavApI masjid in kAshI and subsequent mocking of hindu reverence, had referred to the account (from the authoritative Islamic hadis shAhih bhukari) of impregnation of a 9 year old by "sab se nek insAn" of the "religion of peace". This upset a lot of muslims, who began making death threats to varied hindu-s, including those who supported Nupur Sharma's right to refer to authoritative Islamic beliefs about their prophet - This despite BJP suspending Nupur Sharma in appeasement of Islamic countries and people, Nupur's apology, and several police complaints and legal action against her. 

One of these was kanhaiya lAl, whose social media account had shared some post in support of Nupur. (kanhaiya claimed that it was his son who had inadvertantly shared this post.) On June 11, Lal's neighbor Nazim had registered a police complaint against him - but kanhaiya got bail. On June 15, Lal had filed a request for protection with the local police after receiving death threats from nAzim and five others. Lal alleged that the group had circulated his photo within their community on social media with a message that Lal should be killed if seen anywhere or if he opens his shop. The police - instead of protecting him, claimed to have mediated and settled the matter. 

One of the attackers had, according to later police statements, had developed links with Dawat-e-Islami and Tehrik-e-Labiak, the Islamist organizations from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and had visited that terrorist state.

## Aftermath
A handful of people were there at the place, all fled - only a Rajput assistant, Ishwar Singh fought the Jihadis, sustained severe injuries and was admitted to Maharana Bhupal Hospital.) The assailants fled on foot and then drove away on a motorcycle.

Local authorities of Udaipur imposed a 24-hour curfew and blocked internet access across the state of Rajasthan. Thousands of people rallied and protested in udayapura. Within a day of the murder, hindus had gathered over a crore rupees for the Hindu tailor's family and that of the injured Ishvar Singh.
