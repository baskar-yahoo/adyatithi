[description]
en = "It was ramzAn. Shayista Khan was occupying shivAjI's palace lAl mahal in puNyanagarI. shivAjI arrived at night and infiltrated at night (tales say - pretending to be a marriage party, others say - pretending to be part of the mogol army). shivAjI and co entered via kitchen, killed the cooks. Maid servants alerted shaiste khAn (who supposedly hid in the bed chamber). In the following scuffle, shaiste lost his fingers (to shivAjI's sword, they say). His eldest son, son in law, 40-50 men were killed. Few women were wounded. shivAjI's side: 6 killed, 40 wounded. Then shivAjI escaped quickly, crossed the river, and escaped back - aided by cavalry detachments placed on the way. It was believed that this attack was done in connievance of the mogol rAjaputra general jasvant singh, who was nearby. Shaiste (who was incidentally fluent in sanskrit) went back; was dismissed by awrangzeb from deccan and reappointed to bengal (not being allowed to show his face). This daredevil attack raised shivAjI's prestige all over India."
