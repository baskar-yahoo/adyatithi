[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`ta:nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Nandanar, a Pulaiyar (agricultural labourers/singers) by birth, was born in Adanoor in the Chola kingdom. Known for his deep humility and devotion, Lord Shiva was his only solace. Nandanar would often visit sacred pilgrimage sites, providing temples with leather drums and other musical instruments. However, due to his community's traditions, he always worshipped from outside the temple premises.

Once, Nandanar longed to visit Tirupunkur to see Lord Shiva and offer his services. At Tirupunkur, his view of the deity was obstructed by the Nandi statue in front of the temple. In response to Nandanar's fervent prayers, Lord Shiva commanded Nandi to move aside, allowing Nandanar to have a clear view of the deity. This event was so significant that the statue of Nandi in Tirupunkur remains shifted to one side even today. After fulfilling his desire of digging a tank near the temple, Nandanar returned to Adanoor.

Nandanar's next aspiration was to visit Chidambaram and witness the cosmic dance of Lord Nataraja. Despite his intense yearning, he hesitated to enter the temple due to his low birth, and remained outside, praying fervently. Recognizing his devotion, Lord Shiva appeared in his dream, instructing him to undergo a fire bath and join the Brahmanas in the temple.

The Brahmanas of Tillai, also guided by a divine dream, prepared a sacred fire for Nandanar. Respectfully inviting him, they witnessed Nandanar walk into the fire, only to emerge transformed with a new holy body adorned with sacred ashes, holy thread, and matted locks. Nandanar then entered the temple and was absorbed in Lord Nataraja's dance. A bright light enveloped the scene, signifying Nandanar's union with Lord Nataraja, as he attained oneness with the deity.
