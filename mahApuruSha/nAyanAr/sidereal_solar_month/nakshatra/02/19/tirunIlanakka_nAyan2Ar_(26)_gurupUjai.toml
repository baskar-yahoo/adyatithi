[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`ta:nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiruneelanakka Nayanar, the 26th of the Nayanars, was a devout Brahmana proficient in Agamas, and resided in Tirusattamangai, a spiritually vibrant city in the Chola kingdom. Known for its dedicated Brahmanas and the temple of Ayavanthinathar (today's Brahmapureeshvarar (Ayavandheeshvarar) Svaami Temple https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHqaB7hJypLzZRUH9), this city was a centre of Shiva worship. During a Tiruvathirai festival, while Tiruneelanakka and his wife were worshiping in the temple, she instinctively blew on the Shiva Lingam to clean it from a spider, accidentally spitting on the the Shiva Lingam, an act her devout husband perceived as desecration. Angered, he abandoned her and returned home alone.

That night, Lord Ayavanthinathar appeared in Tiruneelanakka's dream, showing that the part of His body his wife spat on was the only part not affected by the spider's poison, revealing the greatness of her devotion. Realising this, Tiruneelanakka Nayanar joyously reconciled with his wife, understanding the Lingam as a living presence, not just a stone.

When the revered saint Tiru Jnana Sambandar (the 28th of the Nayanars) visited Tirusattamangai with companions, Tiruneelanakka Nayanar welcomed them but hesitated to accommodate the non-Brahmana companions inside his home, asking them to sleep near the sacrificial pit. Miraculously, the sacrificial fire ignited by itself near them, enlightening Nayanar about the transcendence of caste through devotion. Sambandar, acknowledging Nayanar's devotion, included him in a song of praise.

Yearning to be in Sambandar's presence, Tiruneelanakka later attended Sambandar's wedding in Nallur Perumanam. When Sambandar merged into the divine light of Lord Shiva, Tiruneelanakka Nayanar also attained union with the divine, fulfilling his deepest spiritual longing."""
