Having stayed in the Pīṭha for thirty-seven years, He reached the Supreme Abode at Aruṇācala on the New moon day of the month Āṣāḍha in the year Ăśvara. This preceptor Bodhendra, also known as Sānandrānanda, was honoured for poetical excellence by Kings—Bhoja, Kalaśeśvara and others and was intent on travelling through the earth."
