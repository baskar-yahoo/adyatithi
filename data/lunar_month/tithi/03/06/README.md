He shared his dream with villagers by saying that in his dream Lord Venkateswara Swamy appeared and asked him to bring the temple to Past Vaibhavam (glorious) by performing Deepa Naivedya Aaradhana and Lord disppeared. As per the Lord words, Archaka Swami Sundaraju performed first pooja on July 1940 which was coincided on Ashada Shudda Shasti Day with the help of village elders. To mark the auspicious day of revival of Nitya Pooja Kainkaryam, TTD has been conducting this festival as Sakshatkara Vaibhavotsavam on Ashada Shuddha Shasti Day in the Jyaishta month every year._
