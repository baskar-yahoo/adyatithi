## Muḍavan Muḽukku
முடவன் முழுக்கு is observed on day 1 of Vṛścikaḥ (solar) month (arunodaya/puurvaviddha (default)).

_Nadha Sharma (முடவன், i.e. lame man) and his wife Anavidyambikai came to Mayavaram in order to perform a तुला स्नानम् in Kaveri. However, by the time they arrived, it was the last day of तुला मास and they could not complete the स्नानम्. They were disappointed yet spent their time doing Puja of the Lord, who appeared in their dreams and asked them to take a bath next morning (1st day of Vrschika) and reap full benefits of the Tula Kaveri Snanam itself!_
